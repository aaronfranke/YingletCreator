# Yinglet Creator

A unity app that let's you make yinglets and take pictures of them.

That's it. No gameplay or anything.

The project is available for free download on steam.

## What's a Yinglet?

A little rat bird gremlin creature created by [Val Salia](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/valsalia/)

## But why?

Why not.

## Is this open source?

This project is primarily made public for easier modding.

If you want to contribute to the project itself though, you're welcome to open a PR.

**At this time, I ask that you do not make any derivative projects using this app or any of its assets.**

# What do I need?

- A copy of Unity 2025
- (Recommended) Blender 4.6+
  - (Recommended) The UCPaint extension (texturing without it is a struggle)

# Modding overview

Mods are packaged as Unity resource bundles.

You can think of these as fancy folders containing:
 - **Raw assets**: Textures (.png) and models/animations (.fbx)
 - **Scriptable Objects**: Metadata files that describe how the assets should be made available.

Create your assets, define your metadata, and bundle your package. Do all that and you'll have a mod that you can publish on the steam workshop, or add manually.

That's the jist of it. To dive in, read these tutorials:
- Creating a fur pattern
- Creating a hat
- Creating a pose
- Bundling a mod
- ScriptableObject reference

 If you have any questions, ask me or the community on the Discord.
